# HousePricePrediction_AdvancedTreesModels

House Price Prediction

This repository contains a comprehensive Python script for predicting house prices using various regression models. The project demonstrates an end-to-end data science workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

Overview

The script utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms to predict house prices based on a rich dataset containing various features of houses. The project applies data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve optimal predictions.

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of two main files:

train.csv: Training data with features and house prices.
test.csv: Test data with features for which the model will predict house prices.
Features

The script includes the following key features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing distributions and relationships between variables.
Model Training: Utilizing algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and more.
Model Evaluation: Assessing models based on cross-validation and mean squared error.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing models using GridSearchCV.
Feature Importance Analysis: Understanding the impact of different features on the model's predictions.
Requirements

To run the script, the following Python libraries are required:

numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
xgboost
lightgbm
catboost
